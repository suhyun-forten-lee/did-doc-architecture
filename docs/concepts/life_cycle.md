The diagram below illustrates a typical workflow supported by the OpenDID protocol. Specific workflows are determined by issuance policies, and users proceed through registration steps, service connections, and application execution to securely store DID Documents and VCs within their wallets.

A Wallet, DID Document, and VC each have their own lifecycle. For more details, please refer to the following detailed descriptions.

### 1. Wallet Lifecycle States
* `INSTALLED`
* `CREATED & DEPERSONALIZED`
* `PERSONALIZED`
* `OPERATION`

#### - INSTALLED
Indicates the state of wallet app installation.

#### - CREATED & DEPERSONALIZED
Signifies wallet creation (DB, file) without user binding.
<br>
User binding (PII registration) and wallet locking functionality can be optionally combined.

#### - PERSONALIZED
State where user information is bound, enabling DID issuance and VC issuance.
<br>
If user information (PII) is deleted, wallet reverts to stage 2 (CREATED & DEPERSONALIZED).

#### - OPERATION
State where DID is issued, allowing all DID/VC related functionalities.
<br>
Upon deletion of user information (PII), the wallet status changes to stage 2 (CREATED & DEPERSONALIZED).
